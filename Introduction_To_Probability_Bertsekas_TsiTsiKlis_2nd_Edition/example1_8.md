### Problem :
#### Statement 
A conservative design team, call it C and an innovative design team call it N , are asked to sperately design a new product within a month.  
from past experience we know that :  
(a) The probability that team C is successfull is 2/3
(b) The probability that team N is successfull is 1/2
(c) The probability that at least one team is is successful is 3/4
#### Question 
Assuming that exactly one successfull design is produced , what is the probability that is was design by team N?

### Solution
let us reframe the question first, what is the event that one succefful design is produced given it was designed by team N . 
now at first glance wehn you decide about the sample space that P(C) + P(N) > 1 !! of course because you need to get P(C) + P(N) - P(N and C )
i started by looking at the sample of space of P(N)
