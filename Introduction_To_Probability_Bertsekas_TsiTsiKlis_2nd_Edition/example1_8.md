### Problem :
#### Statement 
A conservative design team, call it C and an innovative design team call it N , are asked to sperately design a new product within a month.  
from past experience we know that :  
(a) The probability that team C is successfull is 2/3
(b) The probability that team N is successfull is 1/2
(c) The probability that at least one team is is successful is 3/4
#### Question 
Assuming that exactly one successfull design is produced , what is the probability that is was design by team N?

### Solution
Let us first understand the sample space . this is most similar to throwing two coins , where heads is success and tail is failure. the sample space size is 4 . 2^2 

CN  : Both teams were successfull
C'N' : Both teams are unuccessfull 
C'N : Conservative team is not successfull and Innovative Team is successfull
CN' : Concervative team is successfull and  Innovative team is successfull 

Now we understand the general sample space. now let us understand the conditional probability .  
Assuming that exactly one successful design is produced ( assuming one head shows up ) what is the probability that is designed by team N .
