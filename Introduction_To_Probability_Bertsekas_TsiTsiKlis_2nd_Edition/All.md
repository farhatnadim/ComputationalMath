# Chapter 1

## Conditional Probability 
is the probabilty of an event A given an event B written as is stated P(A|B)  is the likelihood of the event A happening given B as a new sample space. Conditional Probability follows the framework of probability  
$P(A|B) = P(A\cap B ) \div P(B)$

### Algorithm for probability Calculation in tree based sequential description


### Multiplication Rule 
Assuming that all of the conditioning events have positive probability, we have

$ P(\cap^{n}_{i=1}A_{i}) = P(A$
