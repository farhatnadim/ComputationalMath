# Chapter 1

## Conditional Probability 
that is stated P(A|B) is the probabilty of an event A given an event B, is the likelihood of the event A happening given B as a new sample space. Conditional Probability follows the framework of probability  
$P(A|B) = P(A\cap B ) / P(B)$
### Multiplication Rule 
Assuming that all of the conditioning events have positive probability, we have

$ P(\cap^{n}_{i=1}A_{i})$
