## Conditional Probability 
is the probabilty of an event A given an event B written as is stated P(A|B)  is the likelihood of the event A happening given B as a new sample space. Conditional Probability follows the framework of probability  
$P(A|B) = P(A\cap B ) \div P(B)$

### Algorithm for probability Calculation in tree based sequential description
1- Setup the event of interest as a leaf in a tree   
2- The event of interest is considered as a sequence of events from the root leading to the leaf and we know that the probability of a  sequence of events can be multiplied 
3- We record the conditional probabilties associated with the branches of the tree 
### Multiplication Rule 
Assuming that all of the conditioning events have positive probability, we have

$ P(\cap^{n}_{i=1}A_{i}) = P(A$
