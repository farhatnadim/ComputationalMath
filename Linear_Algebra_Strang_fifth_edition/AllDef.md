## Vector Spaces and Subspaces
Q: what is a subspace ?  
A: A Subspace is a subset of a vector space where the vectors of the subspace can be written as a linear combination of each others.
The vector zero should be always part of a subspace to be considered a subspace . 

Q: What is the dimension of a subspace ?  
A: The dimension of a subspace is the number of independent vectors in that space . 

Q: What does it mean for a set of vectors to span a subspace ?  
A: A set of vectors spans a space if their linear combinations fill the space.
