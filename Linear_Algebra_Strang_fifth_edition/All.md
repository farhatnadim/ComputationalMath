#### Problem   
The vector $\vec{b}$ is in the subspace spanned by the columns of A when "    " has a solution . The vector $\vec{c}$ is in the row space of A when  "    " has a solution.
#### Solution 
The vector $\vec{b}$ is in the subspace spanned by the columns of A when the equation $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$ has a solution. The vector $\vec{c}$ is in the row space of A when the equation $A^T\vec{y} = \vec{c}$ has a solution.
#### Problem 
True or False : if the zero vector is in the row space , the rows are dependent .
#### Solution
False : The zero vector is always in the row space of any matrix.

### 13 * 
#### Problem
