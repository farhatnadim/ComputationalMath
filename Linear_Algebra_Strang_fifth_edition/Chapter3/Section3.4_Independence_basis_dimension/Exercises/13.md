#### Problem
Find the dimensions of these 4 spaces . Which two of the spaces are the same ? (a) The column space of A (b) The column space of U (c) The row space of A (d) The row space of U.  
$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0  \\ 1 & 3 & 1 \\ 3 & 1 & -1   \end{bmatrix}$ and $U = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2  & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}$
#### Solution
The column spaces and row space for both A and U  have dimension = 2.   
When we perform reduced row echelon form ( check sympy code below) of the Matrix A  has two pivot columns that means the rank of the marix is 2 and the column space dimension is 2
The reduced row echelon form  of the Matrix A transpose has two pivot columns that means the ranks of the matrix is 2 and the row space dimension is 2 .We expect the dimension of both row space and columnes space for U since U is a reduced form of A 
which tow of the spaces are the same ? I tried to think what it really means for two vectors spaces to be same , I found in the solutions strang states that two spaces are the same is when each of their vectors is a linear combination of the others . The way to compute that is to to take a vector from one space and set it as a solution for the column space of the first matrix , if there is a solution( or inifinte solution ) that means that the solutin is part of the column space and if that applies to other vectors then one vector space belongs to the other but if you do the other way arround you can prove that both of them are the same !!!!


#### Sympy Solution 
```python  
import sympy as sp 

A = sp.Matrix([[1, 1,0], [1, 3, 1], [3, 1, -1]])
U = sp.Matrix([[1,1,0],[0,2,1],[0,0,0]])
print("A Reduced Row Echelon form",A.rref())
tr_A = A.T
print("Transposed Reduced Row echelon form ",tr_A.rref())
print("U Reduced Row Echelon form",U.rref())
tr_U = U.T
print(tr_U)
print(tr_A)
# True
```
